ABSTRACT

Mental health issues are increasingly prevalent in today's fast-paced world, yet their diagnosis remains largely subjective and time-consuming. To address this gap, SVARABHAVANASLESA presents an AI-powered Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system designed to analyze a person's emotional state using voice input. By allowing users to upload or record speech, the system performs real-time sentiment analysis using advanced natural language processing and deep learning models such as Whisper and Hugging Face Transformers.

The tool extracts features like pitch, pace, and silence from audio inputs to determine emotional tone and generates sentiment reports with graphical visualizations. Designed for use by both individuals and mental health professionals, the system offers a secure, web-based interface built using React.js, FastAPI, and MongoDB, with role-based access for doctors and patients.

This scalable platform not only facilitates early detection of emotional distress but also enables ongoing emotional trend tracking through a dedicated dashboard. By combining machine learning with speech analysis, SVARABHAVANASLESA bridges the gap between technology and mental healthcare, offering a non-intrusive and insightful tool for emotional well-being.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

1.1 Purpose of the Project

The Speech Emotion Recognition System (SVARABHAVANASLESA) represents a groundbreaking advancement in the field of mental health assessment and emotional analysis. In today's rapidly evolving healthcare landscape, the need for objective, data-driven approaches to mental health evaluation has become increasingly crucial. Traditional methods of emotional assessment often rely heavily on subjective observations and self-reported data, which can be influenced by various factors and may not always provide accurate insights into a patient's true emotional state.

The primary purpose of SVARABHAVANASLESA is to revolutionize the way mental health professionals assess and monitor emotional states through advanced speech analysis technology. By leveraging cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, the system provides a comprehensive platform for analyzing speech patterns, vocal characteristics, and emotional indicators in real-time. This innovative approach offers several significant advantages over traditional assessment methods.

Early Detection and Intervention
The system's ability to detect subtle changes in emotional states enables early intervention in mental health conditions. Through sophisticated speech pattern analysis, SVARABHAVANASLESA can identify emotional distress before it manifests in more severe symptoms. This early detection capability is particularly valuable in preventive mental healthcare, where timely intervention can significantly improve treatment outcomes.

Objective Assessment
Traditional mental health assessment methods often rely on subjective observations and self-reported data, which can be influenced by various factors. SVARABHAVANASLESA provides objective, quantitative metrics for emotional state evaluation, reducing the subjectivity inherent in traditional assessment methods. The system generates standardized measurements of various emotional parameters, including stress levels, emotional intensity, and mood patterns.

Treatment Monitoring
The system's ability to track emotional changes over time provides valuable insights into treatment effectiveness. By maintaining detailed records of emotional patterns and responses, healthcare providers can better assess the impact of treatment interventions and make necessary adjustments to treatment plans. This longitudinal tracking capability helps identify patterns that might indicate the need for intervention.

Accessibility and Convenience
SVARABHAVANASLESA makes mental health assessment more accessible through its web-based interface and remote monitoring capabilities. By eliminating geographical barriers and providing 24/7 availability, the system makes mental health assessment accessible to a broader population. This increased accessibility is particularly important in areas with limited access to mental health professionals.

Data-Driven Insights
The system's analytical capabilities provide healthcare professionals with evidence-based insights into patient emotional states. By collecting and analyzing vast amounts of speech data, SVARABHAVANASLESA supports more informed treatment decisions and contributes to the development of personalized care plans.
